Narrator: Our story begins with four young adventurers seeking to make their mark on the world.
Narrator: Their journey will lead them to the town of Novis Initiis.
Scarlett: It has been quite a long journey and we have not seen a hint of conflict in ages. 
Scarlett: I hope you are all keeping yourselves sharp.
Scarlett: I'd hate to see any of you lost to a slime.
Alexander: How could *I* lose to a slime my dear.
Mori: Life is pain and suffering.
Mori: The only sure thing about life is that we die.
Mori: Why do we keep running from the inevitable?
Scarlett: Oookay… moving on.
Alexander: !!! Look! Up ahead! Bandits!
Scarlett: Shut it you oaf, you’ll give away our position.
Merlyn: We should take this opportunity to practice.
Merlyn: After all, Scarlett is right. We should keep our skills honed.
