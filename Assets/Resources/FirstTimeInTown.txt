Merlyn: That was refreshing, though I believe we must replenish our stores as well as rest before moving on to the next area.
Alexander: Hah! Those dumb bandits never stood a chance against us!
Alexander: We are too smart and strong for them.
Scarlett: Well most of us are smarter anyway...
Alexander: What did you say?
Scarlett: Oh nothi-
Leif: Pardon me, I could not help but overhear that you have taken care of the bandits outside of town?
Merlyn: That we did.
Leif: Could I implore you then, to speak with our king?
Leif: We have been having some trouble with monsters nearby and have been looking for able bodied young warriors like yourselves.
Scarlett: I suppose we could drop by. We will get paid, correct?
Leif: I would think so, but you should really talk it over with the king.
Leif: He resides in the manor near the center of town.
Leif: I will send word that you are willing to meet, until then, how about you explore the town a bit.
