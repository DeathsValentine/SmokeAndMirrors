  - 'Merlyn: That was refreshing, though I believe we must replenish our stores as
    well as rest before moving on to the next area.'
  - "Alexander: Hah! Those dumb bandits never stood a chance against us! We\u2019re
    too smart and strong for them."
  - 'Scarlett: Well most of us are smarter anyway...'
  - 'Alexander: What did you say?'
  - 'Scarlett: Oh nothi-'
  - "Leif: Pardon me, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear that you\u2019ve taken care
    of the bandits outside of town?"
  - 'Merlyn: That we did.'
  - 'Leif: Could I implore you then, to speak with our king?'
  - 'Leif: We have been having some trouble with monsters nearby and have been looking
    for able bodied young warriors like yourselves.'
  - 'Scarlett: I suppose we could drop by. We will get paid, correct?'
  - 'Leif: I would think so, but you should really talk it over with the king. He
    resides in the manor near the center of town.'
  - "Leif: I\u2019ll send word that you\u2019re willing to meet, until then, why
    don\u2019t you explore the town a bit."
